            <p>Raven has been a Charleston, South Carolina resident since the spring of 2010. Although she is no stranger to the deep south, this is her first adventure on the East Coast. Born and raised in northwest Florida she also spent 5 years in Alabama obtaining her Bachelor and Master's degrees.</p>

            <p>As a part of the Lowcountry Community Raven is involved in the Auburn Alumni Association's local club, the Lowcountry Auburn Club. Having served on the Board of Directors for 4 years she has held the role of Vice President for one of those years as well as President for one year. She is also a member of the Eliza Lucas Pinckney chapter of Daughters of the American Revolution. She is also a member of the Charleston Young Professionals as well as partakes in their Mentee program.</p>

            <p>In her spare time, Raven is training in Aerial Arts as her fitness routine. She is focusing on Aerial Silks, however, she has a small amount of experience in all of the apparatuses offered at Aerial Fit. </p>

            <p>Although she has a past in varied fields and professions, she began her stint at BoomTown in the summer of 2010 and as a result has found a passion in software. With many months of delving into Treehouse and Codecademy she has been working on obtaining skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Bootstrap. Feeling that these skills, although valuable, are not very practical without having formal training in the field, Raven has decided to take the leap into this new world by attending The Iron Yard Academy for Front End Engineering in January 2015. After a grueling 3 months she plans to put her new skills to the test at the professional level as well as work on some personal projects she has been dreaming of creating for some time now!</p>

            <p>When it comes to helping customers there is no job too big or too trivial for Raven. I had the privilege of working closely with Raven for nearly 4 years as she worked tirelessly to help customers in her support role and as she transitioned onto my team as a Quality Assurance Analyst. Raven was not classically trained in computer science or quality assurance, but she knew how to think like her client and was able to proactively help by affecting product quality. She was a great team member and was often looked to for her client-centric contributions in her Sprint teams. She often sought out additional training and was a self-motivated learner and would make a great member for a passionate and highly active and motivated team!</p>

            <p>I worked with Raven when she was a Senior Support Specialist for BoomTown. She was able to quickly grasp new features and share that knowledge with our client base through her impeccable communication skills. Raven was always able to clearly explain our product over the phone and in writing. Her work ethic is also one of her biggest strengths.She is always happy to help out her teammates and her company. We were sad to lose her on the Support Team but glad she followed her passions, moving into a QA role here at BoomTown.</p>

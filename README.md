This is the first website I have created.  I started with a tutorial on Codecademy and then tore the code apart to make it my own.  I used BootStrap for the first time and that made things easier in some ways and harder in others.

This site comprises of HTML5, CSS3 and BootStrap.  It is a one page site that contains my resume, a short bio as well as links to some of my social media sites.

It is somewhat responsive, however, once sized down to a mobile device the text on the images just past the Jumbotron do not resize nor are they centered properly.

I plan to make another resume site in the near future that utilizes some of my skills I will be learning soon and make it "branded" to match my header image on my blog <a href="http://raveve.com">raveve.com</a> and my personal business cards.
